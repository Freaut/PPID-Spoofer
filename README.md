# PPID Spoofer

A way to create processes with PPIDs which can be used to effectively disguise the relationship between the child process and its true parent process (making it appear as if it was created by a different legitimate Windows process) by leveraging the Windows API to manipulate process attribute lists.
Can be used to bypass detection by security solutions and defenders that rely on parent-child process relationships to identify potentially malicious activity.
